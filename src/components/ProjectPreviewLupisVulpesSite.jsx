                    <p>This project is heavily inspired by artist and animator LupisVulpes. As fan of her art i decided to dedicate website to her. But most importantly this website is archive and guide to new people who recently discover this artist and want to learn more about her art. Since she started her art path more than 10 years ago, it's hard to learn about her old art since a lot of arts/animations are deleted/lost/forgotten and this website came to help all this people by providing - art and animation gallery, - information of all characters ever created, - presentation of her art path</p>
